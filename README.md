Project still in Development

System reqirments: python 3, OpenCV 2, numpy

The goal is re-grade bouldering routes using the V# scale by the type of each rock holds in a given route. OpenCV is used to extract the rock from an image using edge dectection and image processing. 
Pytorch will be used to train a model in 5 classifications of common boulder holds: Pockets, Slopers, Crimps, Jugs, and Footholds
